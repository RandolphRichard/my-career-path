## Purpose
* An employer wants to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples.
So I created a portfolio so that they can review samples of my work and assess whether I am a good candidate for an open position.

## Requirements
* GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
* THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
* WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
* WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
* WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
* WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
* WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Built With
* HTML
* with advanced CSS codes


## Personal description
* I have also created a sample of my resume as a second HTML page.
* I have also linked my personal website on some of the work section link, But it's under construction right now.
* 2 css files were created. 
* all the links are targeted somewhere and will open on a new window tab.
* I have downloaded a picture from my freepik account and credited the designer on the CSS file.
Well this is the assignment üòä . I tried as much as I can to cover a lot of @Media screen .
